The US Presidential election is determined by an arcane institution called the Electoral
College. Each state receives a number of electors equal to its number of senators
plus its number of representatives. (The District of Columbia also receives electors
as if it were a state but no more than the least populous state, according to the 23rd
Amendment.) The number of senators is set by the constitution (2 per state), but The
number of representatives is determined by the Congress itself.

Since 1929, it has been set at 435. Before then, it had been incrementally increased
as states were added to the union and the population of the country increased.
