Historical Context
==================

As outlined in the Constitution, the election of the President is not by the popular
vote, but instead through an arcane institution called the Electoral College (the EC).
The EC comprises electors from each of the states (and since 1961, also the District
of Columbia), who cast votes for the candidates running for president. The candidate
receiving a majority of electoral votes becomes President; if no candidate receives
a majority of electors, then the president is chosen by the House of Representatives.

The Constitution sets the number of senators each state receives (2) and the number
of representatives to be determined every 10 years by the Congress. Since 1929, this
has been determined by the Reapportionment Act of 1929. It set the total number of
representatives to be 435 for all future apportionments; and since 1941, the
Huntington-Hill apportionment method has been used to determine how many representatives
each state receives in proportion to its census population.

In addition, the 23rd Amendment was ratified in 1961, which provides for the District
of Columbia to have the number of electors it would have if it were a state, but not
more than the least populous state. This effectively guarantees it 3 electors under
the current law of 435 total representatives, bringing the total number of votes in
the Electoral College to its current value of 538 (2 senators for each of the 50 states,
435 representatives, and 3 electors for DC). This has been the number of electoral
votes in every presidential election since 1964.

Faithless electors
------------------

In most states, the electors are law-bound to vote for the plurality winner of their
state's popular vote for president. But in Nebraska and Maine, only 2 electors (the
number awarded for state senators) vote for their state's plurality winner; the
remaining electors vote for the plurality winner of their designated congressional
district. There have been instances in previous presidential elections of so-called
"faithless electors" who cast votes for candidates for whom they were not supposed to
vote. Indeed, there were 7 faithless electors in the 2016 election. But no election
has ever been decided by faithless electors.

Contingent elections
--------------------

If no candidate receives a majority of votes in the electoral college (for instance,
if there is a tie or a third-party candidate wins enough votes) then the president
is chosen by the House of Representatives, each state delegation receiving 1 vote.
Twice has the House had to chose the President: once in 1801 and again in 1825. If
the House fails to elect a President, then the Vice-President, who is chosen by the
Senate, becomes President.

What if DC were a state?
------------------------

Suppose that the District of Columbia were admitted as a state sometime before the
next apportionment in 2031. It would be allocated 2 senators as a state and 1
representative; this would increase the total number of representatives in the House
to 436 and keep the total number of electoral votes at 538. But with the next
apportionment in 2031, the total number of representatives would be set back down
to 435, and they would be apportioned among the (now) 51 states in proportion to their
census populations. This means that in the 2032 presidential election, there would
be only 537 electors (2 senators for each of the 51 states plus 435 representatives).
