ECSim Documentation
===================

ECsim is a package for exploring the outcome of past US presidential elections if the
number of electors in the electoral college were different. The number of electors
allocated to each state is equal to its number of senators in the Senate plus its
number of representatives in the House of Representatives. (Since 1961, there are
also additional electors allocated for the District of Columbia as if it were a state,
as specified by the 21st Amendment.) The number of senators each state has is specified
in the Constitution, while the number of representatives is set by the House itself.
The  with different
numbers of representatives in the House of Representatives, and hence different numbers
of electors in the electoral college.
